==Qizmt Coding Standards for Contributors==

 * There is and has never been deprecation in the functionality of Qizmt, including methods exposed to mapreducer, local and remote jobs. We put a fairly heavy amount of thought and time into getting the overall design right to prevent this. All versions of Qizmt aim to be 100% reverse compatible.

 * Always use spaces for indentation, not tabs. 4 spaces per indent. You can set this in your Visual Studio settings.

 * Try to keep lines shorter than 80 characters. 

 * When you edit a file, try to stick with the conventions used in the surrounding code. 

 * Write your contributions using Visual Studio.net 2008 with the VisualSVN plug-in.

 * Avoid mixing purely cosmetic changes (such as removing trailing white-space) with functional changes, as this makes review of the actual change (whether it’s a check-in or a patch) more difficult. 

 * Never place a ‘{‘ or ‘}’ on the same line as other code, e.g.

*Acceptable*

{{{
public void SomeFunction()
{
    //
}
}}}

*Not Acceptable*
{{{
public void SomeFunction(){
    //
}
}}}

 * Always submit patches or commits with sufficient comments to well document the change. Start with what the change accomplishes followed by as much specification about the change as possible.

 * Avoid unnecessary inline comments in your code contributions and opt for good variable and function names. Unnecessary inline comments typically create a maintenance issue.


==Qizmt Overview==

This guide is intended for use by:

 * Those who wish to download the Qizmt source code.

 # Select *OK* and the *Repository Browser* will show<Br/><img src="http://qizmt.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/Qizmt RepositoryBrowser.png" alt="Qizmt Repository Browser" />
 # Expand the tree view and Right-click the *trunk* folder and select *checkout*.<Br/>

 # Select *OK* on the *Checkout* window
 # Wait for the checkout progress to complete<br/><img src="http://qizmt.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/Qizmt_CheckOutProgress.png" alt="Qizmt Checkout" />
 # At this point you have downloaded the Qizmt source code
 # Navigate to Qizmt source code directory<br/><img src="http://qizmt.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/Qizmt_Directory.png" alt="Qizmt Directory" />
 # Run the *DistributedObjects.sln* solution to load the Qizmt source code into Visual Studio.
 # Select *OK* on the Source Control prompt<br/><img src="http://qizmt.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/Qizmt_OkPrompt.png" alt="Qizmt OkPrompt" />
 # Select *“Temporarily work uncontrolled”* on the next Source Control prompt. The solution has both TFS and SVN bindings, however you will just be using SVN. If you commit (check-in) a patch with modifications to the TFS bindings it will be rejected<Br/><img src="http://qizmt.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/Qizmt_UnableAccessDB.png" alt="Qizmt Unable Access DB" />
 # Once the project is open you will see a little green light next to all items in the *Solutions Explorer*. This tells you that the item has not changed since you last *updated (same idea as “get latest” in TFS)*<Br/><img src="http://qizmt.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/Qizmt_VS.png" alt="Qizmt VS" />
 # Hit *Ctrl-Shift-B* to build
 # On your Windows desktop, right click on *my computer icon* and select *properties*. Then select *advanced system settings* then select *Environment Variables…* in the *Advanced* tab. Under *System variables* select the *path* variable and select *“Edit…”* Add *;<qizmtdir>\MySpace.DataMining.DistributedObjects\bin\Debug\* to the end of the path. Then select *OK, OK, OK*
 # In Windows, click on the start button and enter into *start search* “visual studio 2008 command prompt” and hit enter
 # Using the Visual Studio 2008 Command Prompt, navigate to:<Br/>*<qizmtdir>\MySpace.DataMining.DistributedObjects\bin\Debug\*
 # Run the command *installutil MySpace.DataMining.DistributedObjects.exe*
 # In Windows, click on the start button and enter into *start search* “Services” and hit enter.
 # Locate the *Distributed Objects* service<br/><img src="http://qizmt.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/Qizmt_Services.png" alt="Qizmt Services" />
 # Right click on it and select *start*
 # At the Windows command line issue the command *qizmt @format machines=localhost*
