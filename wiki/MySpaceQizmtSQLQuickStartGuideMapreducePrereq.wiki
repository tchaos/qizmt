=Qizmt Mapreduce Prerequisite=

Mapreduce commonly refers to an easy way to optimally process very large amounts of data which is split across a cluster of many machines. Qizmt is a mapreduce framework developed specifically for large clusters of Windows Servers with non-blocking dedicated bandwidth between each machine. Unlike other available mapreducer solutions, Qizmt has a built-in IDE/Debugger and functions as a single solution for rapid mapreduce development/deployment/maintenance. The concepts in this document assume basic understanding of Qizmt mapreducer development.

Here are some guides which may be used to master basic Qizmt mapreduce development:

|| Qizmt Quick Start Guide || So you are ready to install Qizmt on your development machine? <Br/>This guide will walk you through every step of installing Qizmt on your development machine, creating and executing mapreducer jobs, as well as specifications on the tools used to develop Qizmt mapreducers, and strategies for optimizing mapreducer pipelines for common data processing tasks. ||
|| Qizmt Reference Guide || This guide is a listing of all the objects available to mapreducer jobs which make writing highly efficient mapreducers easy. ||
