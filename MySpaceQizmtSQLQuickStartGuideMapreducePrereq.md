# Qizmt Mapreduce Prerequisite #

Mapreduce commonly refers to an easy way to optimally process very large amounts of data which is split across a cluster of many machines. Qizmt is a mapreduce framework developed specifically for large clusters of Windows Servers with non-blocking dedicated bandwidth between each machine. Unlike other available mapreducer solutions, Qizmt has a built-in IDE/Debugger and functions as a single solution for rapid mapreduce development/deployment/maintenance. The concepts in this document assume basic understanding of Qizmt mapreducer development.

Here are some guides which may be used to master basic Qizmt mapreduce development:
